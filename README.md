## ðŸš« About Zero Days & The Psychology of Progress

A "Zero Day" is a day when you make zero progress toward your goalsâ€”no matter how small. The concept comes from productivity psychology: the more zero days you have, the harder it is to build momentum, stay motivated, and feel accomplished. Even a tiny step forward can break the cycle of procrastination and self-doubt.

**NimbusTasks is designed to help you cut down on zero days:**
- By making it easy to log even the smallest task, youâ€™re encouraged to do somethingâ€”anythingâ€”every day.
- The visual calendar and task highlights help you see your streaks and avoid gaps.
- Recurring tasks and reminders keep you accountable, so youâ€™re less likely to let a day slip by.
- Checking off tasks, no matter how minor, gives a dopamine boost and reinforces positive habits.

**Why does this work?**
- Psychologically, seeing progress (even a single checkmark) builds self-efficacy and motivation.
- Avoiding zero days helps you maintain momentum, which is key to long-term success in any areaâ€”work, study, fitness, or personal growth.
- NimbusTasks makes it easy to celebrate small wins, which add up to big results over time.
